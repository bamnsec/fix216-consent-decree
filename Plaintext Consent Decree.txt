procedures on fi eld training will delineate the criteria and methodology for selecting
FTOs and field training sergeants. The City will work with the unions to allow only
highly qualified officers to serve as FTOs and Field Training Sergeants. Taking into
account the collective bargaining agreements with the unions, CDP will revise its
eligibility criteria to select FTOs and Field Training Sergeants based on their written
applications, performance evaluations, previous performance as police officers, and
complaint and disciplinary histories.
